    <p> SYSTEM ANALYSIS
->1 Existing System
In the current offline method, buying and selling second-hand books is done through bookshops, notice boards, or personal contacts.
This system is:
•	Time-consuming
•	Unorganized
•	Limited in choices
•	Lacking price comparison
•	Difficult for sellers to reach many buyers

-.2 Proposed System
The proposed online system offers a centralized platform where users can:
•	Register/Login
•	Upload books with details
•	Search and browse books
•	Use a cart and place orders
•	View order history
•	Admin can manage users, books, and orders

Uses simple tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP. Easy to develop.
